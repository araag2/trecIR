This is patient's 3rd flare in 2 months, while still on steroid taper which is new for her. She responded well to 125 mg IV steroids q 8 hrs and IV diphenydramine in addition to her continuing home regimen. CBC was at her baseline, w/normal differential. Serum tryptase revealed a high value at 84. The patient failed aspirin challenge due to adverse reaction. She was stabilized on IV steroids and IV benadryl and transferred back to the medical floor. She continued on her home histamine receptor blockers and was transitioned from IV to PO steroids and benadryl and observed overnight and was discharged on her home meds, prednisone taper, GI prophylaxis with PPI, Calcium and vitamin D, and SS bactrim for PCP.

The physical exam revealed jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and hypotonia of the upper limbs. He had a constant smile on his face, however, he has aggressive behavior according to his parents' explanation. His laboratory study was significant for a low serum caeruloplasmin (0.05 g/l), and a raised 24 hour urine copper excretion (120 \u03bcg/24 h).
