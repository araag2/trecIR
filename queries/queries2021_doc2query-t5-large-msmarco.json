He had an excellent response to therapy and was monitored off treatment for approximately two years. He then presented in [**7-/2122**] with a rising white count, approximately 50% lymphocytes, and a mildly elevated LDH. He also had some mild worsening palpable lymphadenopathy. He then received four cycles of PCR, but did not have much in the way of response and his treatment regimen was switched to R-CVP of which he received two cycles. He did again not have a significant response, though continued to have an excellent performance status, and he was ultimately switched to Campath therapy. He did have resolution of his lymphocytosis, and his white count has come down nicely, but did not have much in the way of response in terms of reducing his bulky lymphadenopathy. He then eventually had developed an enlarging left cervical node which was biopsied and was found to have Richter's transformation. ",

He was maintained on Dilantin and phenobarbital. The patient went 20 years without another seizure.

She recently noticed gradual enlargement of her hands and feet and recognized that her ring is getting small for her finger. There is some irregularity in her menstrual cycle as well as some nipple discharge. She also has positive history for snoring and headache. The physical examination revealed subtle facial features of acromegaly and prognathism. Visual fields are normal by confrontation. Hirsutism, soft tissue thickening and diaphoresis of the hands and feet are noted. Laboratory evaluation in the fasting state reveals IGF-1 of 968 ng/mL and random GH of 19.7 ng/mL. MRI reveals a macroadenoma with no invasion. She is on stable doses of octreotide LAR since her diagnosis was confirmed. She is married and has 2 children.

Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and two C/sections. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She doesn't smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones and biliary sludge. The largest gallstone is 0.7cm. Surgery consultation recommends elective cholecystectomy. ",

The patient reports that he is currently homeless and has lost his supply of insulin, syringes, glucometer, and glucose testing supplies. The patient states that at the time of his initial diagnosis with type 1 diabetes he was hospitalized with a glucose value >1000 mg/dL. At the time, he was experiencing polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. He reports that he has been on insulin since the time of his diagnosis, and he has never been prescribed oral agents for diabetes management. Most recently, he has been using insulin glargine 55 units once daily, and insulin aspart sliding scale 3 times daily. The patient has had previous episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis, for which he was hospitalized. With this episode of hyperglycemia, he is not experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort, and he appears well. His lab studies showed: A1c: 11.3% Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL with eGFR >60 mL/min Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 17 U/L Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 14 U/L Beta-hydroxybutyrate: 0.1 mmol/L Bicarbonate: 25 mEq/L Anion Gap: 14 mEq/L ",

Examination shows bilateral swellings around the molars. The swellings have increased since his last examination. Several extraoral lesions are detected in the head and face. The swellings are non-tender and attached to the underlying bone. Further evaluation shows increased uptake of radioactive substance as well as an increase in urinary pyridinoline. His serum alkaline phosphatase is 300 IU/L (the normal range is 44- 147 IU/L). His family history is only significant for hypertension in his mother and DM type 2 in his father. The diagnosis of Paget's Disease of Bone was confirmed and Bisphosphonate will be started as first-line therapy. ",

His medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. He smokes cigarette 1 pack per day for 40 years and alcohol consumption of 5 to 6 beers per week. He is not aware about his family history. He is using Levothyroxine, Atorvastatin and HTCZ. His vital signs were stable in the primary evaluation. Left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, and left-sided hemiplegia were seen in the physical exam. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was calculated as 7. Initial CT angiogram of head and neck reported no acute intracranial findings. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was administered as well as high-dose statin therapy. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit to be monitored for 24 hours.

Later the tremor became continuous and extended to both hands and legs and even at rest. The Kayser-Fleischer' ring was detected in the ophthalmologic exam. The physical exam revealed jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and hypotonia of the upper limbs. He had a constant smile on his face, however, he has aggressive behavior according to his parents' explanation. His laboratory study was significant for a low serum caeruloplasmin (0.05 g/l), and a raised 24 hour urine copper excretion (120 \u03bcg/24 h). Wilson disease was confirmed by high liver copper concentration (305 \u03bcg/g dry weight of liver). ",

The patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications. Neck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA), as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.
