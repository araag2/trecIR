    "eligibility_prompt": "Hello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility.\nThe factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\nYou should check the inclusion criteria one-by-one, following the steps below:\n1. For each inclusion criterion, first think step-by-step to explain if and how the patient note is relevant to the criterion. You should explain in detail if there is relevant information.\n2. Then, if there is relevant information, you must annotate a list of relevant sentence IDs of the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.\n3. Finally, annotate the patient eligibility for this specific inclusion criterion: the eligibility must be 'no relevant information' if there is no relevant information. Otherwise, the patient can only be 'included' or 'not included' if there are relevant sentences. 'included' means that the patient meets the inclusion criterion, and 'not included' means that the patient contradicts the inclusion criterion.\n4. You should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(inclusion_criterion): list[str(relevance_explanation), list[int(sentence_id)], str('included'|'not included'|'no relevant information')]}\n",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability…). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinarytract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MSduration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most commonsymptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied asspecific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thuscould increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship betweenseverity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past threemonths and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going tovoid, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP)Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night werespecifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done.The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12)questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void(TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I)Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of fallsduring the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms withOAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined asthe time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the otherscores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for therelationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationshipbetween falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria:\nage ≥ 18 years\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis\nLower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment,\nExpanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample plain JSON output without indent:\n{\"age \u2265 18 years\": [\"The patient is a 45-year-old man, older than 18.\", [0], \"included\"], \"Multiple sclerosis (MS)diagnosis\": [\"The patient has never been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, so he does not meet the target conditionof this trial.\", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], \"not included\"], \"Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment\": [\"Thepatient has urinary retention complication and has been treated.\", [0], \"included\"], \"Expanded Disability Status Scalescore between 1 and 6.5\": [\"There is no relevant information of this score in the patient note.\", [], \"no relevantinformation\"]}\"\n"
